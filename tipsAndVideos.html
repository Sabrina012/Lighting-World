            <h1>1) How to Start</h1>
            <p>Designing lights for a show is not as daunting as it seems. Obviously, a person can go as simple or intricate as they want when designing a show, but the most important part is that the actors are lit.</p>
            <p>If you are designing a lights for a musical, listen to the music first. It is helpful for preliminary ideas to first get a feel of the different songs.
                If the song as a sorrowful tone, have a blue wash on the scene. If it is one person and sounds dramatic, consider having light only focused on them. There can also be mood changes within a song that can also signal another design change.
                Keep in mind that these are all preliminary ideas, so you don't have to go excessively detailed</p>
            <p>When designing either a play or a muscial, it is important to have access to the script you want. During these initial steps, you need to look over this script. This allows you not only in your design process but in your understanding of the play as a whole.
                For example, in Pride and Prejudice, Wickham was the initial love interest but was later to be discovered as one of the villains in the play. This can lead to certain decisions of lighting the actor playing Wickham throughout the play.</p>
            <p>Make sure to underline or just put notes on where you want certain events to happen in the script. This will help you keep track of what you want later and when you are watching rehearsals.</p>
            <p>If you are having difficulty thinking about how you want to start designing, look up videos of the play on YouTube. Pay attention to the lighting choices and think about the lights you have access to. This can help generate an idea if you can't picture certain scenes.</p>

            <h1>2) Attending the Rehearsals</h1>
            <p>After organizing your preliminary ideas, go to different rehearsals of the play or musical you are designing. At these rehearsals there a few things that you should take notes on.</p>
            <p>As I stated previously, the most important job of a theater lighting designer is to make sure the actors are visible. Blocking is how the actors are positioned, interacting, and moving in a specific scene.
                Sometimes, one half of the stage might have actors together with the other half completely empty. You would then have to note for that particular scene to maybe only the area with actors lit (depending on the circumstances).
                Taking notes of blocking will later influence how you code designs for the show.</p>
            <p>Another important thing to think about is how the actors are potraying a song. Even though you might have listened to the song before, there is a possibility that the design can change based on how it is presented. This ties into taking notes on the people's blocking.</p>
            <p>An example of blocking is shown below. Based on seeing this at a rehearsal, I knew that I had to have a focus on the middle where the actors were to make it as if they were in a bedroom.
                It was important to note the fact the actors were in the center of the stage rather than the sides and how they did not necessarily move toward the items on the outer edge of the displayed picture.</p>

            <h1>3) Confirming with the Director</h1>
            <p>While the script generally is accurate in terms of when to do blackouts or transition lighting, it is important to always discuss ideas with the director.
                They are the ones who ultimately have a final say because they have a certain way of wanting to portray the show, and they are the most familiar with all the inner workings of the show.
                For example, even though there might be a blackout in the script, a director might want to just leave all the lights on or just have a slight change in how the lights look to demonstrate that transition instead.
                One other instance is whether the change in the lights is to distracting. In my experience, there one was time when my director wanted me to get rid of a light cue because it took away from acting in a particular scene.
                Thus, communicating with the director and others are vital.</p>

            <h1>4) General Tips of Design</h1>
            
                <li>Use lights to reflect a emotions or intentions. Even though it is the job of the actors and actress's to portary what they want in a scene, lighting can amplify this.
                For example, in Pride and Prejudice, there is a scene where two love interests initially meet. To emphasize their love for each other, I spotlighted each person with a pink spotlight with the movers.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Avoid making distracting or drastic changes that would take away from the scene. If it's a particularly emotional scene or musical number, make the movement of the lights and color minimal to allow people to maintain focus on the acting.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Use the lights to highlight certain aspects of the set. Even though the keeping the actors visible is the most important thing to do for lighting, using extra lights to highlight specific aspects of the set when appropriate can boster the overall aesthetic of the project.
                For example, during the bachelorette party in Mamma Mia!, I was advised to use extra movers to highlight hanging pieces on the walls of the set, which added to the festive mood of the party scene.</li>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <li>Check the capabilties of each light that you have. This can will help determine if you can accomplish your design goals or add on to them. You can also get creative with lights with limited capabilities, but you have to test them to see what can be done first</li>

            <h1>1) Safety</h1>
            <p>As a disclaimer, I am not a professional, so these are based on my experience.</p>
            <p>In terms of safety, always wear a hard hat. When hanging lights, there will be a mistake once in a while where something might drop and it can hit you. The hard hat will help protect your head from damage.
                If you are ever working near, under, or helpign with lights, make sure to wear this hard hat as protection</p>
            <p>Another important safety point is making sure to avoid bringing "loose" objects when on an elevated platoform. Loose objects can easily fall and hurt someone below.
                If you bring up tools such as a wrench, try to have a cord to attach it to your person to ensure that if you do accidentally drop it, the wrench can stay with you since the cord would prevent it from falling down.
                In the cases where you have a loose object that cannot be attached to something else, try to keep it in an area that you are aware of so you don't actually kick it down. You can try putting in a deep or sealable pocket to prevent it from accidentally falling down.</p>
            <p>When using a scaffolding (or something similar to it), make sure to put the breaks on to ensure it will not move when a person is on it. This is just to prevent it from moving that can lead to a dangerous situation.</p>
            <img src="https://www.alulock.com/resources/product/752/433/rullestillads-75x245-5.37_1.jpg?width=1024&height=768&bgcolor=fff" alt="Scaffolding Picture" width = 600>
            <p>There will be instances where cables need to be put on the floor, and sometimes it is more convenient to gently toss them onto the floor while on an elevated surface. In those cases, make sure to always warn the people working below to ensure they avoid that area until it is securely on the floor.
                This also applies to when anything is accidentally dropped. Try to warn people of any free falling objects.</p>
            <p>Always ensure the lights are secure. Make sure all the bolts and screws are tightened appropriately.
                One other important thing to have when putting up lights are safety cables. If the screws ensuring the clamp on a light somehow becomes loose and falls, the safety cable (pictured below) is meant to catch it until someone fixes it.</p>
            <img src="https://ikancorp.com/prod1/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/SW-04_004.jpg" alt="Safety Cable Picture" width = 400>
            <p>Evidently, there are more safety precautions that professionals know of. As I stated earlier, I am not a professional, but these are some basic tips that definitely should be followed.</p>
            
            <h1>2) Placement of Lights</h1>
            <p>There is no correct way to place lights. Specific lights might have specific uses, but you can still position them in various ways.</p>
            <p>The important part of deciding where to put lights is to see if they work with your design and have a use throughout the show. For example, there are "specialized" lights where a specific has one job for the whole show.
                Typically, these are  dimmers (lights that just turn on and off) that can be utilized for things such as a bright spotlight on an important object in one scene but is not used any other time. Other times, the light could be used for the specific purpose of giving front light to the actors so they are always visible.</p>
            <p>Dimmers are fixed points of lights, so correctly choosing their positions are crucial since it will be tedious to change them later. Movers, on the other hand, are more flexible. Since movers can direct the focus of their lights in different places, it would be useful to have them in a position where they can effectively access the whole stage.
                I usually put them in the middle because the movement of their lights have their greatest potential.</p>
            <p>For the dimmers specifically, make sure they are positioned in a way that covers the whole stage with light when all of them are on. Avoid having dark spots because they will interfere with the look of the actors on stage.</p>

            <h1>3) Gels</h1>
            <p>Even though gels are not necessary to putting up lights, you need to put them in the light before placing them in high areas to avoid unnecessary work.</p>
            <p>Gels are colored, thin sheets that are placed in frames to be slotted into lights. They enable lights with gels in them to produce colored light.</p>
            <p>A good habit when using gels is to  note the type of color in black sharpie directly on the gel sheet, so you know which color for future use.</p>

            <h1>4) Drawing a Map</h1>
            <p>After putting up all the lights, make sure to note the different addresses the lights are connected to so you can later patch more smoothly while coding.
                Draw a map of the stage from a certain perspective and then draw the locations of the lights relative to that point of view.

            <h1>1) Overview</h1>
            <p>There are many different ways to code how you want the lights to look, and there are numerous commands that are used when coding for cues (at least with the board we typically use).
                Thus, I do not have much to say here except that experience is what allows a person to efficiently code.
                It is helpful to watch videos on YouTube and simply using Google to help figure out different commands to do things.
                Learn how to use the softkeys (which are on the screen) and the actual buttons on the board given.

            <h1>2) Patching</h1>
            <p>Before officially starting to code the designs for the show, you need to patch the lights to the correct channels. Below is a video to help explain it with the EOS board that we have used at Hills. This channel is also helpful for other tips about coding in general.</p>

            <h1>3) Live vs. Blind Mode</h1>
            <p>Live mode when coding lights means that you can see how you are modifying the lights in real time. In contrast, blind mode means that you are essentially coding behind the scenes while showing something else in live mode.
                Even though coding in blind mode will not necessarily give you the look you want for a particular scene, you can always change it later when you are back in live mode.
                Note that there are different ways to save a cue in these two different modes.
            </p>

            <h1>4) Magic Sheets</h1>
            <p> After patching the lights and giving them specific channels (which can be explained through a YouTube video), it could be helpful to make a magic sheet on the software for the show.
                This can allow you to directly click on the lights on the screen that correspond to the correct lights on stage.</p>
